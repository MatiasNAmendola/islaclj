<p>Oh boy! We wrote our very own function! It's a lovely one, isn't it?</p>

<p>
  Our <code>square</code> function takes a single argument -- a number -- and squares it.
</p>

<p>
  Take a look at how our defn form looks. First comes the name of the function, then the argument list
  (which is a vector, and not an actual list), then the body of the function.
</p>

<p>But wait! We don't even know if our function works or not! Let's try it out. Type <code class="expr">(square 10)</code>.</p>
