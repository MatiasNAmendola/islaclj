  Another neat thing about Clojure is that functions can take an arbitrary number of arguments.
  Functions are allowed to specify a 'catch-all' to put an optional and arbitrary number of arguments
  into. Because of this, a lot of Clojure's core functions have interesting capabilities. For example
  the arithmetic functions we've already played with are not limited to two arguments! No sir, they can
  take any number of arguments they wish.

<p>Try it out. Type <code class="expr">(+ 1 2 3 4 5 6)</code> to continue.</p>
