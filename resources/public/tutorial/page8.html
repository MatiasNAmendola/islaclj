<p>Yay! It works!</p>

<p>
  You know, Clojure is a functional programming language. As such, it has first-class and
  anonymous functions. Let's write our square function as an anonymous function.
</p>
<code class="expr">(fn [x] (* x x))</code>
<p>
  If you run this in the REPL above (as you should), you'll note that some very weird and
  cryptic thing is printed. Functions are just normal values like a number, a string, or
  anything else. The cryptic thing is simply how they look when printed.
</p>

<p>
  Our anonymous function isn't very useful if we don't call it. Let's do it. Type 
  <code class="expr">((fn [x] (* x x)) 10)</code>
</p>
