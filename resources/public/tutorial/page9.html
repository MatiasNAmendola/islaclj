  Yay! Notice how we called our anonymous function? We just wrapped the function in parentheses,
  placing it as the first element in this new list and passing it arguments just like we did earlier
  with the arithmetic functions. Awesome, huh?

  You may not know this, but <code>defn</code> is actually just a bit of sugar around <code>def</code>
  and <code>fn</code> to create named functions. We can create named functions without <code>defn</code>
</p>

<p>Type <code class="expr">(def square (fn [x] (* x x)))</code> to continue.</p>
