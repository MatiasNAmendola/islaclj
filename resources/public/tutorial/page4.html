  I bet that caught you by surprise, didn't it? Don't fear! Clojure simply has a built in Rational type.
  We can prove that we've got a rational by running <code class="expr">(type (/ 10 3))</code>. Rationals are more
  concise and precise than floating point numbers. However, we can force Clojure to do floating point
  division by just making one of our numbers floating point.

<p>Type <code class="expr">(/ 10 3.0)</code> to continue.</p>
